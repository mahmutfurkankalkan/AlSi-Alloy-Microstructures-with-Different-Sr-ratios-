# AlSi Alloy Microstructures with Different Sr Ratios

This repository provides a set of Python scripts originally developed for the automated analysis of Al-Si alloy microstructures modified with varying Strontium (Sr) levels. The workflows include segmentation, classification, and quantitative feature extraction (e.g., SDAS measurement), and are intended for use in **Google Colab** environments.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The microstructure images have been removed from this repository. If you require access to the original dataset used in this study, please contact the author directly via GitHub or institutional email.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- **`Modification Level Classification.py`**: Predicts the alloy modification level based on microstructural patterns.
- **`Segmentation of AlSi alloys.py`**: Segments primary and eutectic phases in SEM images.
- **`SDAS_Measurement.py`**: Identifies parallel dendritic features and calculates Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing (SDAS) metrics.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python ‚â• 3.7
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL
- Matplotlib

All scripts are developed and tested in **Google Colab**, and optimized for notebook-based workflows.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Image Characteristics Matter**  
  The scripts assume uniform grayscale SEM images (ideally 512√ó512 pixels). If using images with different resolution, magnification, or quality, preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, thresholding) should be adapted accordingly.

- **Measurement Units**  
  SDAS and area measurements are based on pixel distances. For absolute values (e.g., microns), calibration based on image scale bars is required.

- **Tool Usage Scope**  
  These tools are intended for academic and research purposes. Further engineering effort is needed to adapt them for large-scale or production-grade applications.
